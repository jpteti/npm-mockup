    <summary class="faq__question">Why “personalism”? Why “new”?</summary>
    <div class="faq__answer">
      <p>
        The original personalists were a movement of intellectuals and activists in interwar France who responded to the crises of their age with an assertion of the value and significance of the human person. They saw themselves as working in opposition to philosophies which dismissed the individual in favor of the state or nation, and systems  which reduced individuals to economic, political and social atoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        One reason they took the name 'personalist' was - whilst they didn't deny individuals had material needs and interests - they recognised we want, and deserve, much more than that. Our capacity for transcendence, expressed in art and virtue, friendship and self-sacrificial love, was, for the personalists, what made us fully human. We’re spirit as well as flesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        These commitments brought the personalists into conflict with the prevailing social order: “capitalistic in structure, liberal in its ideology, bourgeois in its ethics”. Working for the “spiritual revolution” was one with the struggle for self- transcendence. But Personalism wasn’t an ideology or a theoretical system: it emerged, one participant wrote: “from the comradeship of the road rather than the diagrams of the classroom”. It was less a philosophy than it was a way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don’t think the first personalist movement had all the right answers. But we do think they asked many of the right questions. We start, as one of our inspirations once wrote, “not from new beginnings, but from interrupted paths”.

    <p>
      If we have found ourselves starting again from the very beginning, we do not do so alone. We, the defeated of the last century, arrive as strangers in this one, confessors of a faith never wholly secular, carrying with us nothing for the journey. Nothing except hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leviathan, Capital-State-Empire, rules over every nation: drunk with the blood of martyrs, at war with all life. An enemy who has not ceased to be victorious. An enemy which has triumphed all over the world. But this world is passing away. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It falls to us to remember this. It falls to us, despite everything, not to forget. To speak and act in forms new, and yet the same as always: everything for everyone, nothing for ourselves. One in heart, they held all things in common: With them the brotherhood of man was no mere phrase. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have found ourselves starting again from the very beginning. We have fallen, it seems, very far.  We are still travelling through purgatory; still contending, flesh and blood, against powers and thrones and dominions. What has to be done is beyond us. And we have, despite and because of all this, reason for our hope. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember. We were, we are, we shall be.
    </p>
    <p>Listen.</p>
